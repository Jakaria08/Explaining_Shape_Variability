# Code

Explain briefly what the code does and how it is organized. Provide instructions for running and using the code.

## Models

Describe the models used in your research and how to use them. Include any specific details about model architecture, training procedures, and usage instructions.

## Data Processing

Hippocampus data initially has DTI scans with segmentation masks saved in .nii files. 3D meshes are created from the files and registered to a template shape. Details of preprocessing (scripts for grooming and registration of the Hippocampus data and requirement.txt files) can be found at [Preprecessing] (https://github.com/Jakaria08/Explaining_Shape_Variability/tree/master/preprocessing) and corresponding ReadMe file is [Preprocessing README](https://github.com/Jakaria08/Explaining_Shape_Variability/tree/master/preprocessing)

## Evaluation

Detail the steps involved in the evaluation. Include any scripts or tools provided in the repository for these purposes.

# Setup and Commands

Provide instructions on setting up the development environment and executing key commands. Include dependencies, software versions, and any other relevant information.

# Data

Outline the data used in your research. Include instructions on how to access and preprocess the data.

# Trained Models

If applicable, provide pre-trained models and instructions on how to use them for prediction or further training.

# Supplementary Material

Include any supplementary material related to the paper, such as additional experiments, analyses, or results.

## Visualization

Include visualizations.
